    "San Francisco is one of the booming cities in US and one of the main tourists attractions. Each district of San Francisco carries its own unique and distinct culture. Thus it's quite hard for a new business to become successful and compete with already established restaurnts of various cusines and pizza being one of the main food in the US it's even harder for a new small pizza place to become successful. But if it is possible to anaylize the neighborhoods in San Francisco to find area where there is not much competition and high demand it'll be really useful for a newcomer to be successful. "
